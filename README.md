# Versioning and git

For git branchs is used [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

For git messages is used something like [Angular Commit Message Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit):
* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

For versioning is used [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
